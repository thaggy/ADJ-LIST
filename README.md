# ADJ-LIST
Creates Adjacency List from a .txt file

This will create a simple adjacency list from a text file<br/>
The format for such file should be as follows<br/>
VERTEX# VERTEX#<br/>
VERTEX# VERTEX#<br/>
etc.<br/>
The graph created will be a directed graph so keep that in mind when creating the text file<br/>
